<h1>Low and No Code Automation repository</h1>
<p>This is a repository to store some of the automation work I have done in low and no code platforms (n8n, make, zapier).
<br/> In addition to these I have built many automations, and low/no code AIP integrations using Palantirs Foundry for my unit.</p>
